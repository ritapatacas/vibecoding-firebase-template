# Welcome to your First Coding Project!

This is a simple project to help you get started with coding in Python. Let's take a look at the files you see in this project.

## What's in this project?

*   **`main.py`**: This is the main file where you will write your Python code. It's the only file you need to worry about for now.
*   **Other Files**: You might see other files like `GEMINI.md`, `requirements.txt`, and a folder called `.idx`. Don't worry about these! They are here to simplify things and make sure your coding environment works correctly.

## Getting to Know Your IDE

Your screen is divided into a few important sections:

*   **Explorer (Left Side)**: This is your file cabinet. You can see all the files in your project here, like `main.py`. Click on a file to open it.
*   **Editor (Center)**: This is your workbench. When you open a file, its content appears here. This is where you'll write and edit your code.
*   **Terminal (Bottom)**: This is your command center. You can run commands here to execute your code and see the output.
*   **Gemini Chat (Right Side)**: This is your AI coding assistant. You can ask Gemini questions here, and it will help you on your coding journey.

## Your first challenge: understand the code

Before running the code, let's understand what it does. Your AI assistant, Gemini, is here to help.

In the **Gemini Chat** on the right side of your screen, ask a question like:

> "Can you explain the code in `main.py`?"

Gemini will give you a step-by-step explanation.

## How to Run Your Code

Now that you understand the code, let's run it!

1.  Make sure the `main.py` file is open in the **Editor**.
2.  Click into the **Terminal** at the bottom of the screen.
3.  Type the following command and press Enter:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

4.  You will see "Hello, world!" printed in the terminal. A new file called `hello.txt` will also be created with the same message inside.
