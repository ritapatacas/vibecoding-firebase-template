# Welcome to your First Coding Project!

This is a simple project to help you get started with Python. You should use it for writing your first scripts, let's have a look on this workspace:

## Exploring the context menu

*   **`main.py`**: This is the main file where you will write your Python code. It's the only file you need to worry about for now.
*   **Other Files**: You might see other files like `GEMINI.md`, `requirements.txt`, and a folder called `.idx`. Don't worry about these! They are here to simplify things and make sure your coding environment works correctly.

## Getting to Know Your IDE

Your screen is divided into a few important sections:

*   **Explorer (Left Side)**: This is your file cabinet. You can see all the files in your project here, like `main.py`. Click on a file to open it.
*   **Editor (Center)**: This is your workbench. When you open a file, its content appears here. This is where you'll write and edit your code.
*   **Terminal (Bottom)**: This is your command center. You can run commands here to execute your code and see the output.
*   **Gemini Chat (Right Side)**: This is your AI coding assistant. You can ask Gemini questions here, and it will help you on your coding journey.

## Your first challenge: asking what your code means

Before running some code, lets practice writing a prompt to understand what it does. 

In the **Gemini Chat**, on the right side of your screen, ask:

> ```Can you explain the code in `main.py`?```


## How to Run Your Code

Now that you understand the logic, let's run it!

1.  Check if `main.py` file is open in the **Editor**.
2.  Click into the **Terminal** at the bottom of the screen.
3.  Type the following command and press Enter:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

4.  You will see ```"Hello, world!"``` printed in the terminal. Anything else? Check the explorer window again.
